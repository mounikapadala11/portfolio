## Description

Developed an end-to-end Machine Learning model capable of predicting Diabetic diagnosis using attributes such as BMI(Body Mass Index), Glucose, etc. This model is integrated with the Front end to enhance its utility.

Relevant paper ”Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression” accepted and published in ‘2nd International WIESymp
2021.’ held in Nov 2021

<!-- I worked on this project single-handedly during the summer break following my freshman year at NIT- Trichy. **SEBART-Pro** is a robot that follows a ball while balancing on two wheels. It can also recognize traffic signs and act accordingly. It has two stepper motors for precise position control and used an **Arduino Nano** as the microcontroller. The robot senses the tilt using an **MPU-6050 (6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer)** and converts the values from these sensors into angles using a **Kalman Filter**. It uses the **PID control algorithm** to balance on two wheels and a simple **Convolutional Neural Network** is used to recognize traffic signs.

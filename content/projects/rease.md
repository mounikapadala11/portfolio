Designed and developed a web application using the MERN stack. Created early vision concepts, flow charts, and
wireframes using Figma.

Implemented the front end with the React (Chakra UI) framework and the back end with Node.js.

Leveraged MongoDB as the database, and employed MongoDB Compass to gain a better understanding of the data
schema.

Populated the database with dummy data using Postman and conducted rigorous testing to ensure project functionality,
quality, and performance.

Maintained version control of the project using Git, and deployed updates to the project on regular basis.

## Description

In this project, I implemented the paper **[Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044)**. The neural network, a combination of **CNN** and **LSTM**, was trained on the **MS COCO** dataset and it learns to generate captions from images.

As the network generates the caption, word by word, the modelâ€™s gaze (attention) shifts across the image. This allows it to focus on those parts of the image which is more relevant for the next word to be generated.

Furthermore, beam search is used during inference to enhance the prediction result. The network was trained in **PyTorch** on an **Nvidia GTX 1060** graphics card for over 80 epochs. -->

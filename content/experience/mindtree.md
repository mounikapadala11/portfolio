### Description

Developed a REST API Automation Testing for an Airline Project.

Enhanced webpage testing by automating it through selenium.

Gained proficiency in Application development and Selenium Testing

<!-- - Integrated Rho product with GE Healthcareâ€™s Edison platform which is expected to significantly increase the adoption of Rho among Canadian hospitals. GE Healthcare provided Amazon EKS to deploy Rho, which was originally designed to work on Docker-Compose. As a part of this integration, I wrote Kubernetes manifests to migrate Rho from Docker-Compose to Kubernetes.
- Automated integration testing of all the major backend workflows saving more than 2h of weekly testing time.
- Asynchronously decoupled individual micro-services using RabbitMQ and implemented dead letter queues (DLQs) for each queue to ensure retry of failed messages.
- Wrote Python scripts to automate installation and updation of Rho on customer site.
- Wrote bash scripts to automate the backup and restore functionality of Rho.
